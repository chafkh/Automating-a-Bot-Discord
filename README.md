# Bot_Discord_ Project-
# Nom : Chafi Khermouche / Din Kapo / Mouhsine M'Changama
PROJECT: Our programming project concerns the automation of a bot discord. Initially, its use is limited by the framework of the APE master's program, but it will be used to provide the courses requested. Secondly, it can be used to simulate an English-language workshop. The bot sends out a discussion topic and opens up different chat rooms for students to discuss.

#How to use the Bot 

First of all, to run the code, you need to create an environment on your PC from the terminal. Then, in this environment, install Python and import the Discord.py libraries. Then install the PyPDF2 package. Create a python file in this environment and launch it from the terminal. However, if you copy our code, you'll need to change the token, as the Discord bot invalidates those put online on sites like GITHUB. 

#Bot commands

Course automation

The !MasterAPE command: This command is used to start a conversation with the bot in order to access the APE master courses. The bot will give you a list of the APE master courses. Next, you need to choose a subject number. Next, you must choose a number associated with a teacher. The next step is to choose a number associated with a chapter. The bot will send you the course as a PDF.

#Workshop in English

The !Workshop taille_groupe command: First of all, users wishing to take part in the workshop must go to the "Groupe Work shop" room. This command is used to divide participants between the different voice rooms and determines the number of participants in the group. Then, in the text room, a conversation topic will be assigned.

#!Salon 
the !Salon command: creates the salons needed to use the workshop command.
