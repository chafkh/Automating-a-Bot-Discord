# Automating-a-Bot-Discord
Our programming project concerns the automation of a bot discord. Initially, its use is limited by the framework of the APE master's program, but it can be used to provide the courses requested. Secondly, it can be used to simulate an English-language workshop. The bot sends out a discussion topic and opens different chat rooms for students to discuss.
